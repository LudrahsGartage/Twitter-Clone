# Twitter Clone

This is a simple twitter clone that uses data to generate a feed, allows you to like, retweet and view comments. This was made along with Scrimba's interactive javascript course.

I have added the ability to write a new comment, save tweets data to local storage and delete the user's tweets as well.

To view, open this with a live server on VS Code.
